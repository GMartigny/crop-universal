 - For browsers üëâ [`crop-browser`](https://github.com/GMartigny/crop-browser)
 - For Node.js üëâ [`crop-node`](https://github.com/GMartigny/crop-node)
 - As a CLI üëâ [`crop-node-cli`](https://github.com/GMartigny/crop-node-cli)


## Installation

    npm install crop-universal

import crop from "crop-universal";

const cropper = crop({createCanvas, loadImage});

const url = "path/to/file.png";
const options = {
    outputFormat: "png",
};
const canvas = cropper(url, options);
```
